Data conventions for the spam/ham datasets

- `data/raw/` (optional): store original large datasets here (do not commit large files)
- `data/sms_spam_no_header.csv`: expected two-column CSV `label,text` with no header (this repo's sample is `data/sample_small.csv`)
- `data/processed/`: generated by `src/preprocess.py` and contains `id,text_clean,label`

Label mapping:
- `spam` -> positive class (1)
- `ham` -> negative class (0)

If you add new datasets, document their provenance in `data/README.md` and add a small sample to `data/sample_small.csv` for CI.
